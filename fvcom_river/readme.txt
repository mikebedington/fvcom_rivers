There is an option to

WRF data used are the variables T2, RAINNC, and TIMES. It is setup to take th    hey are taken from monthly netcdf files. An example shell script for using the ncecat program to do this is included.

The WRF grid data comes from a file 



CEH river gauge data

The UK rivers are modelled on the 





Environment Agency river temperature archive

Manually provided data

flow_ratio
total_estuary_length
length_locate_mesh_to_mhw


The flow_ratio and the relationship between length down estuary and salinity are based on Uncles et al. (2015)
